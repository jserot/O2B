Evaluating performance on three implementations of a (naive) GCD algorithm :
- `gcd` function written in OCaml
- `gcd` function written in C and called as an external primtive from OCaml
- `gcd` function implemented in hardware and called as a custom instruction of the Nios2 uP

The two latter implementations are provided by the `extended` Nios platform.
